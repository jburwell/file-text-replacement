Introduction
------------

file-text-replacement is a Python script that performs whole word replacement recursively
over a directory tree.  In order to ensure the integrity of its backup and log files across
multiple execution runs, the script creates a unique process id which is used in all log
file and backup file names.  This process id also provides traceability across execution
runs to support diagnostic activities.

The process id is created from by concatenating the current two-digit month, two-digit day, 
four-digit year together with the current two-digit hour, two-digit minute, and two-digit
second separated by a dash.

Requirements
------------

   * Python 2.5 or higher

While this script should operate on Linux-based and Windows-based operating systems, it 
has only been tested on Mac OS X 10.5.

Operation
---------

The script is executed using the following command line template:

   python replacer/replacer.py [options] search_path search_text replacement_text

The script requires the following arguments:

  * A search path which serves as the root of the scripts search and replace operations
  * The search text to be replaced
  * The replacement text for the search text

The script also supports the following commmand line switches:

  * -b: Create a backup of each file
  * -v: Output verbose diagnostic information to the log

Each execution of the script yields a log file named <process id>-replacement.log in the 
execution directory.  Backup files are named <file name>.<process id>.rbak and are placed 
in the same directory as the original. The script does _not_ process files with the
.rbak file extension.
